It is highly desirable for a bootloader to leverage hardware-based write-protection.

This ensures that errant code does not inadvertently damage the very bootloader needed to repair/replace the firmware.

The PIC16F1454/PIC16F1455/PIC16F1459 does provide such hardware-based write-protection, but only in two sizes:

  * 512 words
  * 4096 words

4096 words is more than what should be needed for a USB bootloader.  512 words seems woefully too few.

An intermediate value would have benefited the device.
